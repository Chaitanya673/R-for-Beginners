# 1. INTRODUCTION TO R PROGRAMMING

* R is one of the most popular analytics tool. But apart from being used for analytics, R is also a programming language. 

* R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

* R is a programming language developed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1993. R possesses an extensive catalog of statistical and graphical methods. It includes machine learning algorithm, linear regression, time series, statistical inference to name a few.

* R is not only entrusted by academic, but many large companies also use R programming language, including Uber, Google, Airbnb, Facebook and so on.

Data analysis with R is done in a series of steps; programming, transforming, discovering, modeling and communicate the results

* Program: R is a clear and accessible programming tool
* Transform: R is made up of a collection of libraries designed specifically for data science
* Discover: Investigate the data, refine your hypothesis and analyze them
* Model: R provides a wide array of tools to capture the right model for your data
* Communicate: Integrate codes, graphs, and outputs to a report with R Markdown or build Shiny apps to share with the world


#### What is R used for?

* Statistical inference
* Data analysis
* Machine learning algorithm

#### Why use R?
Data science is shaping the way companies run their businesses. Without a doubt, staying away from Artificial Intelligence and Machine will lead the company to fail. The big question is which tool/language should you use?

They are plenty of tools available in the market to perform data analysis. Learning a new language requires some time investment. The picture below depicts the learning curve compared to the business capability a language offers. The negative relationship implies that there is no free lunch. If you want to give the best insight from the data, then you need to spend some time learning the appropriate tool, which is R.
