# 1. INTRODUCTION TO R PROGRAMMING

* R is one of the most popular analytics tool. But apart from being used for analytics, R is also a programming language.

* R is not only entrusted by academic, but many large companies also use R programming language, including Uber, Google, Airbnb, Facebook and so on.

Data analysis with R is done in a series of steps; programming, transforming, discovering, modeling and communicate the results

* Program: R is a clear and accessible programming tool
* Transform: R is made up of a collection of libraries designed specifically for data science
* Discover: Investigate the data, refine your hypothesis and analyze them
* Model: R provides a wide array of tools to capture the right model for your data
* Communicate: Integrate codes, graphs, and outputs to a report with R Markdown or build Shiny apps to share with the world
